# the_Oldest_Businesses
I have done  projects like World’s oldest businesses. 
Learning of this  project-Use of  CTE(Common table expression) in this project is good lavel.
In this project, Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are used to simplify complex queries, enhance readability, and improve performance by allowing temporary result sets to be defined and referenced within a single SQL statement. CTEs are particularly useful for recursive queries and for breaking down complex logic into manageable chunks.
